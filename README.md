# Android Personal Contacts

The purpose of this app is:

* Use this app to create a personal contact list.

* Each contact must have a set of required information (e.g., first name, last name) and
other optional information (e.g. company, address, email, phone number, ...)

* A picture can be added to the contact from the photo roll or by taking one.

* The picture of a business card may also be added.

* Contacts must be presented as a list and be searched for.

* It should be possible to call a contact by tapping a phone number.

* When an address is associated to a contact, it should be possible to see the location
on a map.

* Contacts can be updated (any field) or deleted.

* Contacts must be persisted across multiple application launches.
